Hi, Jesse here. I've wanted to add a sliver of content to the internet for way too long. Of all the projects in my life that get squeezed aside this one often reappears which signals to me that I should finally do it. I've made websites for a long time, but always for someone else. The notion that everyone should have their own piece of digital land to garden and curate resonates with me, especially since social media and the internet in general is so :: gestures broadly :: these days. It's not the settling on a design or assembling parts that's difficult, although I will deliberate way too long over those decisions, it's the coming up with ideas to post that's failure to launch. Creative thoughts are always chaperoned by commentary of who cares what you have to say, and you're not a topic expert so you have no right to be publishing. Start with equal parts low self esteem and imposter syndrome, add a generous serving of perfectionism with warm procrastination, mix well, wait forever, and you will have nothing with a side of regret.

This is now a self-help blog.

So I've decided to take a completely different approach this time. Rather than start the process by making grids of rectangles in Figma, looking at hundreds of fonts but never choosing one, or agonizing over an arms folded or not folded profile photo, I'm going to MVP this badboy with all the emphasis on M. Besides, what could be better than a jargony acronym to lend credibility right out of the gate. The plan is to start with nothing (ok, easy), write about this nothing (yes, doing that now), find cool web thing of interest, add said cool thing to site, write about it, and so on. Here's an opportunity to research and implement newer topics like container queries, css color, view transitions, dialog api, or one of many that I don't understand well either. In time larger projects like data visualizations, a ThreeJS scene, or a design system component methodology. There will be non-web writings as wellâ€”music, cooking, fighting creeping fascism, dogs, stuff like that. Who knows, someone could find one of these topics useful or maybe I happen to explain an idea in such a way that clicks for them. And hey, at least it's not AI.

Part of me wants to build this site by hand writing HTML and link a single CSS file just to see how far I can get. I ended up going with [Astro](https://astro.build) because I'm a little familiar with it plus it allows for use of React (which I know), Svelte (which I want to learn), as well as Astro's own components (which I like). It's the right size and level of complexity for what I need, plus it's easy to deploy. Speaking of, I'm using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)'s free plan for hosting which watches the site's repo on Github for changes, redeploying automatically. I'm not at all confident when it comes to this part of the web flow but if I can figure out how get this site from localhost to www, you can also.

So that's about it. We all know that perfect is the enemy of good and I think this here is absolutely good enough.

### Links

I have a bad habit of opening a link to an article in a new tab only to leave it there for days or weeks before getting around to reading it. I happened to have open the relatable article [Finally Owning My Web](https://medienbaecker.com/articles/finally-owning-my-web) by Thomas GÃ¼nther which offered a similar take on this concept as well as links to other pertinent sources including Matthias Ott's newsletter [Own Your Web](https://buttondown.com/ownyourweb).
