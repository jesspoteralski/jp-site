        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          A corporate website requires new content and frequent updates driven
          by the marketing and content teams. However, existing
          workflows-content is created by the content team, then passed to the
          product team for design, and finally to engineering for
          implementation-is often slow and inefficient.
        </p>
        <p>
          With small and already stretched design and engineering teams, this
          handoff-heavy process created bottlenecks. Urgent requests from
          marketing to publish or update web content only compounded the
          pressure, leading to delays and frustration across teams.
        </p>
        <h3>Goal</h3>
        <p>
          <i>
            Design and implement a flexible system that empowers non-technical
            users—primarily marketing and content teams—to independently create,
            assemble, and update web pages. The solution should minimize
            reliance on design and engineering resources, while maintaining
            brand consistency and design integrity.
          </i>
        </p>
        <h3>Proposal</h3>
        <p>
          As a Design Engineer with a background in both marketing and content
          development, I was uniquely positioned to take on this challenge.
          Bridging the needs of three distinct teams—marketing, design, and
          engineering—required thoughtful consideration and a systems-level
          approach.
        </p>
        <p>To guide the solution, I focused on a few key questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            How can non-technical users in marketing manage content and layout
            effectively?
          </li>
          <li>
            How can we ensure design consistency in layout, typography, and
            brand?
          </li>
          <li>
            How will this system integrate with the existing frontend tech
            stack?
          </li>
          <li>
            How can it remain flexible enough to accommodate evolving content
            and design needs?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h2>Layout and Display Pattern</h2>
        <p>
          <i>
            Create a system that enables selected content to be seamlessly
            integrated into a structured, reusable layout framework. This
            framework prioritizes visual consistency, clear hierarchy, and brand
            cohesion across all pages—regardless of who builds them.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          By separating content from presentation and enforcing design standards
          at the component level, the system supports flexibility for marketing
          while maintaining a reliable and polished user experience. It’s
          adaptable to evolving needs, yet grounded in a scalable, maintainable
          structure.
        </p>
        <h4>The Layout element</h4>
        <p>
          The Layout component serves as a flexible container designed to
          structure and arrange one or more Display elements within a page.
          Acting as a parent section or row, it manages spacing, alignment, and
          overall composition, ensuring consistency across different page
          layouts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each Layout instance comes with a set of foundational block-level
          styles—such as padding, margin, background, and responsive
          behavior—providing a reliable framework that supports content
          modularity while preserving design standards. This allows teams to
          compose pages quickly and confidently, knowing that each section will
          adhere to a consistent visual rhythm.
        </p>
        <h4>The Display element</h4>
        <p>
          Display elements are modular, self-contained units of content—such as
          text blocks, images, videos, or interactive components—that live
          within a Layout container. Each Display element is designed to be
          reusable and adaptable, with built-in base styles for typography,
          spacing, and media handling to ensure visual consistency.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Display elements manage their own content and visual styling at
          the component level, their placement, alignment, and overall flow are
          governed by the parent Layout element. This separation of concerns
          allows for flexible content creation while preserving structural
          integrity across the site.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="image-layout">
        <Image src={LayoutA} alt="Layout and display graphic representation" />
        <div>
          <p class="caption">
            Representation of Layout and Display elements individually and
            combined into a page layout
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="copy-layout">
        <h3>Styles</h3>
        <p>
          Each Layout and Display element is encapsulated within its own
          dedicated wrapper, responsible for applying the necessary styles and
          handling specific behaviors. This modular styling strategy ensures
          that both Layout and Display components maintain a clear separation of
          concerns while working seamlessly together.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Layout wrapper defines structural styles—such as spacing,
          alignment, and responsive behavior—as well as visual styling like
          borders, background colors, and section-level formatting. In contrast,
          each Display wrapper applies content-specific styles, such as
          typography, image handling, or media formatting, tailored to the type
          of content it presents.
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach promotes consistency across the system, while giving
          developers the flexibility to build adaptable layouts. When a bespoke
          or more complex design element is needed, it's best practice to create
          a purpose-built Display component with its own styling and logic.

      <div class="copy-layout">
        <h4>Layout style properties</h4>
        <p>
          Layout elements can be thought of as distinct sections that are
          stacked to form a complete page. These sections serve as the building
          blocks for the page’s structure, each contributing to the overall flow
          and hierarchy.

          <p class="caption">
            <b>Width</b> will often be predefined for consistancy but when narrower
            <b>justify</b> can also be used to align the content

          <p class="caption">
            <b>Gap</b> is used to separate the displays within a layout, the number

        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="copy-layout">
        <h4>Display style properties</h4>
        <p>
          Display elements can range from simple content pieces, like a single
          paragraph or image, to more complex structures such as cards or
          feature blocks. These elements are designed for flexibility, allowing
          them to be used in various layout configurations—whether it's a
          full-width row, a grid of cards, or even more intricate arrangements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Display styles focus solely on the outer appearance and structure of
          the element itself—defining aspects such as borders, shadows, or
          margins. The content within the Display element, however, is styled
          independently within the component and cannot be overridden by the
          parent Layout. Instead, it can be extended or customized as needed,
          maintaining separation of concerns between layout and content styling.
        </p>
        <h5>Container queries</h5>
        <p>
          Container queries are what make flexible and adaptable layouts
          possible. Display elements are designed to be versatile, allowing the
          same piece of content to be used in any Layout configuration—whether
          it's a full-width row, a grid, or another structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          By utilizing container queries, each Display element becomes
          responsible for its own layout and styling. Rather than relying on the
          size of the browser window, the Display element adjusts based on the
          size of its immediate container. This allows for more granular control
          and ensures that the content responds to its specific context within
          the page, improving flexibility and responsiveness without
          compromising the layout integrity.
